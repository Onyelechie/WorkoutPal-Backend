In sprint1, my goal was to create a modal dialog that will be used for displaying error messages and actions that require confirmation such as deleting an item. Since this dialog will be used everywhere in the app, I needed to make this code easily accessible and reusable. ChatGPT suggested to use React's Context / Provider pattern. The code it generated was all in one single file. I read the documentation about using the Context API to gain more understanding of its function. Then, I refactored the code by rearranging it and regrouping related code. This custom Dialog API was constantly being maintained and refactored throughout the whole project.
